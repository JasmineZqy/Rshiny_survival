CardioGuardian  
The cardioguardian is an interactive Rshiny app. The survival prediction model is based on Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) and the heart dataset and includes covariates like creatinine_phosphokinase, age, serum_creatinine, and serum_sodium.  
In the sidebar, you could enter patients biological information related to covariates, then you can submit the data to the storage database and save them temporarily. The right side contains the statistical results produced by the prediction model. It includes two sessions. The top session displays a plot, which draws the predicted survival curves of the
individual and fitted population average generated by the prediction model. It could give you a general judgement about the trend of curves.
The bottom session provides an option box to let you select your prefered timepoint. It shows the histogram of population survivals in the selected timepoint, when you hover your mouse above the red and blue lines you can get the label showing the predicted survival for the individual and predicied mean survival for the populaion separately.
And there is also a table summarizing the exact survival for the individual and population as well as the percentile position for the individual within the population.
