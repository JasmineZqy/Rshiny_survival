CardioGuardian
The cardioguardian is an interactive Rshiny app. The survival prediction model is based on Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) and the heart dataset and includes covariates like creatinine_phosphokinase, age, serum_creatinine, and serum_sodium. In the sidebar, you could enter patients biological information related to covariates, then you can submit the data to the storage database and save them temporarily. The right side contains the statistical results produced by the prediction model. It includes two plots, the top one shows the predicted survival curves of the
individual and fitted population average. And the bottom one shows the
histogram of population survivals in the selected timepoint, when you hover your
mouse above the red and blue lines you can see the label showing the predicted survival
probabilities for the individual at any specific timepoint. Also, there is a table summarizing the exact probabilities and percentiles for the individual above the plot.
