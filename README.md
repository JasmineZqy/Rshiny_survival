CardioGuardian
I particiapnt in the development of interactive web apps CardioGuardian using R shiny
The cardioguardian is an interactive rshiny app. In the sidebar, you can
enter patients data, and you can submit the data to the database. The right side
includes two plots, the top one shows the predicted survival curves of the
individual and fitted population average. And the bottom one shows the
histogram of all patients survivals in the selected month, when you hover your
mouse above the red and blue lines you can see the label showing the survival
probabilities. Also, there is a table listing the exact probabilities and percentile
position above the plot.
